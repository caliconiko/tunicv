This is a thing I'm making using opencv to read trunes. Currently unfinished though lol

### Data JSON 

Maybe I'll use the json thing to mass test images.

#### Format

```js
{
    "words": [
        {
            "file": "file path",
            "translation": "translation of word",
            "syllables": "number of syllables",
            "full": true
        },
        ...
    ]
}
```
